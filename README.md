AI Engineering Portfolio - Gabriel
Welcome to my AI Engineering Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of Jupyter notebooks and projects demonstrating my expertise in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. As an aspiring AI engineer, I’ve built these projects to highlight my skills in developing, implementing, and deploying AI models for real-world applications.
About Me
I’m Gabriel, a passionate AI engineer with experience in machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis. This repository contains hands-on projects that reflect my ability to solve complex problems, work with industry-standard tools, and deliver impactful results. My goal is to contribute to innovative AI solutions that drive value in fields like [insert relevant fields, e.g., healthcare, finance, or computer vision].
Projects

Other: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model deployment

Getting Started
To explore my projects, follow these steps to set up the environment and run the notebooks:
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
[Optional: List specific libraries or tools, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch]

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Gabrielnkl/notebooks.git
cd notebooks


Create a virtual environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Launch Jupyter:
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab


Open any .ipynb file to view the project code, explanations, and results.


How to Use
Each notebook is self-contained with:

Clear problem statements
Step-by-step code implementations
Visualizations and results
Explanations of methodologies and findings

Feel free to explore the notebooks to understand my approach to AI engineering challenges.
